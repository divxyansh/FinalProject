# Ensemble Classifier

This repository implements an ensemble machine learning classification model combining multiple base classifiers. The goal is to enhance predictive performance through model diversity and intelligent voting.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project is structured with modularity in mind:
- **`baseclassifiers.py`**: Defines individual base classifiers like SVM, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.
- **`ensemble.py`**: Combines these classifiers into an ensemble using a voting-based or hybrid strategy.

## 🚀 Features

- Modular base classifiers
- Easy-to-extend ensemble logic
- Built-in training and evaluation pipeline
- Configurable ensemble strategies (e.g., majority voting, soft voting)

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ensemble-classifier.git
cd ensemble-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
